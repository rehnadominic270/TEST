Git is a version control tool for managing  files and directories.
We can track and record previous changes and we can maintain different versions of source code.
Developers can work independently by using git


Different commands are
git init- to initialize the working directory
git add- to add files to staging area

git gui- for pushing the changes from local repository to remote repository

or we can use the below commands instead of git gui.

git commit -m "message"
git push orgin
